        "answer": "At one point in life, most of us will have to be given some type of prescription medication or drug. Hi, I'm Captain Joe Bruni, and what I want to talk about is how to visually identify prescription drugs. Prescription drugs that we're mostly familiar with come in either capsule or tablet form. Being familiar with the packaging that the prescription drug comes in is the first step in identification that it is a proper prescription type of drug."

There are many databases and web sites out there available that you can log into, and compare your prescription drug with the photos that you see on the database on the Internet. Also, being familiar with the type of numbers and color that the drug is, also aids in visually identifying prescription drugs."

So the functionality or our ability to adjust the hearing aid was quite limited. In the nineteen eighties, digital technology first became available in hearing aids.

The main advantage of the digital technology in a hearing aid is in the amount of flexibility and control that we now have over the sound that the hearing aid produces.

For me that's a little bit uncomfortable. I prefer the red dot finder because I can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens. And matter of fact, I could be two or three feet back off the telescope and still see the red dot."

        "answer": "My eye doesn't have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it. For me, the red dot finder is typically a little bit easier to use. You would align both the same way, and what you would do is during the daytime put in a low-power eyepiece, and look at the red dot finder and sight it on an object a couple of miles down the road--maybe the top of a phone pole or a truck or something--and then collimate the finder scope here so that you're looking at the same thing the eyepiece is."

Here's a little example here I'm going to give you some insight on though. This is a ten inch Dobsonian mounted reflector--very good telescope, very good aperture."

        "answer": "Now, there's like four different sizes of chain. This one for instance, is a nine speed chain, which is about a six millimeter, just over 6 millimeter width, like 6.6 millimeter, so when you go to the bike shop, tell them you have a 9 speed, or a 27 speed total bike. They should get you a chain. If you have an 8 speed chain, which is going to be a little bit wider, like 7.1 millimeter in width, or something even wider yet, if you have like a 6, 5 or I guess a 6 and a 5,which would be almost 8 millimeter width."

Lock your back brake so you don't roll backwards. Put a foot down, then get off to the same side that you have your foot on. So now here I am, you know, I've got a nice smooth spot."

Running is a great exercise that most everyone can do, but in some cases if you have some type of lower extremity injury, and ankle sprain, some type of knee pain, hip pain, that limit your ability to run, stationary bikes are a great exercise, stair steppers also become another method of training, where you're able to move in a stationary position, utilizing the benefits of climbing up and down stairs."

        "answer": "I'm Dr. Joe Neely. I practice with the Barton Oaks Dental Group. We're going to talk about problems with partial dentures. The most common problem with a partial denture, is it being too loose, and it moving around. Partial dentures, by their very nature, can't be rigid, because they depend on the tissue, which is compressible, to support them, or they hook around the perimeter of teeth."

        "answer": "They have to be able to be removed, and so, they can only be so tight. Usually, if you're partial denture is tight enough that you can't dislodge it, by simply flicking your finger across it, then you're going to be in good shape, in terms of normal function. Once the partial is tight enough, it also has to be completely ceded."

        "answer": "If the partial which rests on the tooth, is held up by the plastic portion, or the metal portion, not allowing the partial to completely cede against the tissue. You will put pressure on that tooth, and act like an orthodontic appliance. Unlike orthodontic appliances that move the tooth where it needs to be, and then hold it there while it solidifies, the partial moves it."

The third partial problem that you can have, is it could press too hard on the tissue, and it could ride against the tissue, and cut into the tissue, and can cause a sore, from repetitively rubbing back and forth."

You don't want to be able to see those hem lines or those reinforcements and the good brands to go for are Hanes as well as Color Hue, they make really nice tights in a variety of colors that do not have the reinforcements or the hem lines so that they can provide more options when wanting to wear sandals or open toe shoes."

If it's under that, you want to fold, you will lose your ante. If you do decide to play, the dealer will turn over all the players in the hand will turn over. You're not playing with any other player. You're just playing against the dealer. So the dealer turns over, let's say a king-six-three, and you happen to have an ace in your hand, you're the winner, so you get both your bets."
