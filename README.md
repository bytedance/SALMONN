üöÄüöÄ Welcome to the repo of **SALMONN**!

The SALMONN model family consists of a series of advanced multi-modal large language models. For more details, please refer to the corresponding branches.

## üî• News
- [2025-06-01] We have opensourced **QualiSpeech** dataset - A speech quality assessment dataset with natural language reasoning. You can use QualiSpeech to develop your own audio LLM for speech quality assessment or to evaluate the low-level speech perception capabilities of existing audio LLMs. Feel free to download it [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/QualiSpeech)!
- [2025-03-03] We have released the data processing scripts and finetuned model checkpoints for **SALMONN** for speech quality assessment! See [here](https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN/tree/speech_quality_assessment)!
- [2024-09-04] We have released the model and inference code for **video-SALMONN**! See [here](https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN/tree/videosalmonn)!
- [2024-05-28] üß≥ We have released all the annotations (including 600k SQA/AQA data and 50k audio-based storytelling data) for the 3-stage training of SALMONN! Feel free to download them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15cQO--rtMM9JD22y-A5oXXvT3DujgE2e/view?usp=sharing)!
- [2024-04-07] ü§ñ We have released all the codes you need to train your own SALMONN! Try some cool things!
- [2024-01-16] üíñ Our paper was accepted by ICLR 2024!
- [2023-11-13] üéÅ We have released a **7B version of SALMONN** at [tsinghua-ee/SALMONN-7B](https://huggingface.co/tsinghua-ee/SALMONN-7B) and built the 7B demo [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tsinghua-ee/SALMONN-7B-gradio)!
- [2023-10-08] ‚ú® We have released [**the model checkpoint**](https://huggingface.co/tsinghua-ee/SALMONN) and **the inference code** for SALMONN-13B!
